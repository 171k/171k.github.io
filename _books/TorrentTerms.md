# 🌐 BitTorrent: Seeds, Peers & Leechers

A little bit about torrent that I learnt while erm... not-doing-illegal-stuff :D

---

## 🧪 Basics

- **BitTorrent** is a **peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol** for sharing large files.
- Files are split into **pieces** and exchanged between users instead of downloaded from a single server.
- Swarm health depends on the **number of seeders, peers, and leechers**.

## 📚 Key Terms

| Term | Definition | Notes / Tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Seed** | A user who has **100% of the file** and is uploading to others | More seeders → faster downloads; a finished leecher can become a seed by staying online |
| **Peer** | A user **currently downloading** parts of the file and uploading what they have | Partial downloaders; increase file availability for others |
| **Leecher** | A user **downloading** who may not upload back or uploads very little | Bad leechers stop sharing; ideally, leechers continue uploading |
| **Swarm** | The group of all users sharing a specific torrent (seeders + peers + leechers) | Healthy swarm = high seed-to-leecher ratio |
| **Tracker** | A server that **coordinates peers** in the swarm | Helps peers find each other; file transfer happens directly between users |

## ⚡ Quick Tips
- ✅ Check **seed-to-leecher ratio** before downloading for faster speeds.
- ✅ Stay **online as a seed** to help swarm health and availability.
- ✅ Peers should **upload while downloading** to maintain the torrent ecosystem.
- ⚠️ Torrents with **few seeds** can be slow or unavailable.

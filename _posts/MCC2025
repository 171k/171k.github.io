# MCC 2025

There is SOOOO much to talk about this programme. I love the environment, everyone is soooo nice. Its been awhile since last I've met people who heavily share the same interest as me (cybersecurity), I am so grateful I was chosen for this event as I could say IT IS life-changing. I learnt new stuff such as Detection Engineering and Azure too! I think that is all I wanna yap here. Maybe will yap more in linkedin. Overally, I love this programme so much!
Thank you RE:HACK!

On 2nd August this year, I joined a workshop held by RE:HACK called Cyberskills Level Up help in German-Malaysia Institute (GMI). Since I only managed to join on day 1, I couldnt actually get the full benefits of the workshop. Oh before you ask, lemme say that I only join on day 1 because I got exam on 4rd August and I havent studied yet hehe. My fault but atleast I attended day 1~

In the first session, we were supplied with a vm filled with tools to work with the artifact. We get to analyse a... memory! This is my only second time joining a blueteam/forensic workshop so I am quite slow with it.. but I managed to learn a thing (or two) about Memory analysis! 

In our second session, we learnt malware analysis which is more interesting than memory analysis (sorry), I learnt to use several tools that may assist me in doing analysis. It was quite confusing at first but I got hooked with it!

Last but not least, it is really a knowledgeable experience. I wish i could join more workshop like this.

Also, the food is super good. Thank you GMI.
